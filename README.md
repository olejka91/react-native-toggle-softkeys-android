Copy ToggleNavigationBar folder to 
Android -> app -> src -> main -> java -> com -> name_of_your_project*

Don't forget to change import paths of your module in ToggleSoftKeysModule and ToggleSoftKeysPackage and also add a name of current package to MainApplication.java file

Well, now it's done.
1. Run react-native server with npm start
2. Run simulator or connect device
3. Run android build

Issues: 

Build tested, if something went wrong true to clean android build or invalidate cache and restart Android studio.

If it does not helped take a look at working example.

Feel free to ask any questions.
